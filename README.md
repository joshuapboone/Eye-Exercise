# Eye Exercise
# PacMan Exercise
<img src='oneeye.png'>

In this exercise I built a simulation of two eyes that follow the users mouse movement.  This exercise brings together my skills in JavaScript and CSS.

How to run: Download a master file of this repository to your computer, which will be a zip file.  Extract files from the zip file.  Click on the index.html file and you will be brought to a webpage.  Move your mouse across the screen and watch the eyes follow the movement of the mouse.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to make the eyes blink on a loop after a set time has passed.

License information: This exercise and code was developed via the MIT xPRO Web Development with JavaScript course.
